#### 解释：

1. select a specific date range
   1. ```
      activity_date > '2019-06-27' AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27' 
      ```
   2. ```
      activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
      ```
   3. [DATEDIFF(date1, date2)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function\_datediff): this function returns date1 - date2 expressed as a value in days from one date to the other:
      1. `DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date)<30 AND DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date)>=0`
      2. `DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) BETWEEN 0 AND 29`
   4. [DATE\_SUB(date, INTERVAL expr unit)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function\_date-add): this function performs date arithmetic, if the syntax does not support adding or subtracting days directly using operators such as '+' or '-':
      1. `activity_date BETWEEN date_sub('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND '2019-07-27'`
2. count only distinct users as there are users having more than one activity per day, and the final results are grouped by day.

## 代码

````sql
```mysql
select activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users
from Activity
where activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
group by activity_date
