#### 解释：

```csharp
ONE TABLE: Queries
There is no primary key for Queries table.

PROBLEM: find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

quality :   ratio between query rating and its position
            poor query percentage :  percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
            rounded to 2 decimal places

STEPS:
    ROUND(,2)
    GROUP BY query_name
    SUM(rating/position)/COUNT(*) for quality
    SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100/COUNT(*) for poor_query_percentage
    
```

## 代码

````sql
```mysql
select query_name,
    round(sum(rating / position) / count(*), 2) as quality,
    round(sum(case when rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end) * 100 / count(*), 2) as poor_query_percentage
from Queries
group by query_name
```
