#### 解释：

1. The inner subquery selects the minimum order date for each customer by grouping the rows based on the customer ID.
2. The outer query uses the inner subquery's result as a filter condition to retrieve rows from the "Delivery" table where the customer ID and order date match the minimum order date for each customer.
3. It applies the condition using the WHERE clause.
4. The query uses the IF function to assign a value of 1 if the order date matches the customer's preferred delivery date, and 0 otherwise.
5. It calculates the sum of these values for all rows satisfying the condition.
6. The count(\*) function is used to determine the total number of rows for each customer.
7. The ratio of immediate deliveries is calculated by dividing the sum by the count and multiplying it by 100.
8. The result is rounded to two decimal places using the ROUND function and labeled as "immediate\_percentage."

## 代码

````sql
```mysql
select round(sum(if(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date, 1, 0)) / count(*) * 100, 2) as immediate_percentage 
from Delivery
where(customer_id, order_date) in
(
    select customer_id, min(order_date) 
    from Delivery
    group by customer_id
);
