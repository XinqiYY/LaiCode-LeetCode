## 解法一：

The subquery selects the manager IDs from the employee and groups them based on the number of reports they have. The `HAVING` clause filters out the `managerId` having a count of reports greater than or equal to 5.

```sql
SELECT 
    ManagerId
FROM 
    Employee
GROUP BY ManagerId
HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >= 5
```

Next, we perform an inner join `JOIN` between the table from this subquery and the table `employee` to obtain all the manager names.

```sql
SELECT
    Name
FROM
    Employee AS t1 
JOIN
    (SELECT 
        ManagerId
    FROM 
        Employee
    GROUP BY ManagerId
    HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >= 5) AS t2
ON 
    t1.Id = t2.ManagerId
;
```

## 解法二：

We can also use the `IN` clause in combination with a subquery.

Similar to the previous approach, the subquery selects the manager IDs from the `employee` and groups them based on the number of reports they have. The HAVING clause is then used to filter out the `managerId` having 5 or more reports.

```sql
SELECT 
    ManagerId
FROM 
    Employee
GROUP BY ManagerId
HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >= 5
```

Next, we select the names from the `employee`, where the `ManagerId` is present in the table obtained from the subquery using the keyword `IN`. This way, we retrieve the names of managers having at least 5 reports.

```sql
SELECT
    name
FROM
    employee
WHERE
    id IN (
        SELECT
            managerId
        FROM
            employee
        GROUP BY
            managerId
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
    );
```

## **知识点:**&#x20;

* `HAVING` :filters out the `managerId` having a count of reports greater than or equal to 5.
* `IN`：检查某个列的值是否与指定的值列表中的任何一个匹配
