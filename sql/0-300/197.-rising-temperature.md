#### 解释：

1. Join the Weather table with itself, denoting the first occurrence as `w1` and the second occurrence as `w2`.
2. Compare the dates of `w1` and `w2` using the `DATEDIFF()` function to check if they are consecutive days (with a difference of 1 day).
3. Add a condition in the WHERE clause to select the rows where the temperature of `w1` is greater than the temperature of `w2`.
4. Select the `id` of `w1` as the result.

## 代码

````sql
```mysql
select w1.id 
from Weather w1, Weather w2
where datediff(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
and w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;

````

## **知识点:**&#x20;

* MySQL uses DATEDIFF to compare two date type values.
