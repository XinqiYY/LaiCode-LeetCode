# 1164. Product Price at a Given Date

## 题目

Write an SQL query to find the prices of all products on `2019-08-16`. Assume the price of all products before any change is `10`.

#### Leetcode链接：[https://leetcode.com/problems/product-price-at-a-given-date/?envType=study-plan-v2\&envId=top-sql-50](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-price-at-a-given-date/?envType=study-plan-v2\&envId=top-sql-50)

#### 解释：

> 1. Group the table with the `product_id` field and find the first changed date over `2019-08-16` by using `MIN` aggregation function on `HAVING` clause.
> 2. Set the `price` table as `10`.
> 3. Group the table with the `product_id` again, and find the `product_id` field and the last changed date until `2019-08-16`.
> 4. Find the last changed `new_price` field with the last changed date.
> 5. Union the two tables by using `UNION ALL`.

## 代码

```sql
SELECT
  product_id,
  10 AS price
FROM
  Products
GROUP BY
  product_id
HAVING
  MIN(change_date) > '2019-08-16'
UNION ALL
SELECT
  product_id,
  new_price AS price
FROM
  Products
WHERE
  (product_id, change_date) IN (
    SELECT
      product_id,
      MAX(change_date)
    FROM
      Products
    WHERE
      change_date <= '2019-08-16'
    GROUP BY
      product_id
  )
```
