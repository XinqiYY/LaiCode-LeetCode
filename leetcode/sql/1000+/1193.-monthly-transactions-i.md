#### 解释：

Looking at the result table we write the basic select statement\
`SELECT ___ as month, country, __ as trans_count, __ as approved_count, ___ as trans_total_amount,___ as approved_total_amount`\
`FROM Transactions`

Now we form the solution column by column, starting from month.\
As the month column contains only a part (year and month) from trans\_date column in Transactions, we use `SUBSTR()` function to select a substring of trans\_date starting from index 1 and going upto 7th index: `SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) as month`.\


Now, we go for trans\_count column (as country column is as it is taken from table Transactions), looking at the result table, we need to count the number of transections per month in a country so, we count transaction ids and GROUP them by month and country.

Now for next approved\_count column, we need to check if the state of transection is "approved" if yes then we count else we don't. For this here we used CASE statement along with SUM() function as follows:\
`SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END).`\
`Lastly, modify the select statement by adding:`\
`SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END) as approved_count`

Now for trans\_total\_amount, as we have already grouped transactions based on month and country so, we can directly write trans\_total\_amount column as SUM(amount).

As we wrote the condition for approved\_count column similarly, we\
can write for approved\_total\_amount. The only difference is instead of adding 1, in case the state = 'approved', we add transaction amount: SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then amount else 0 END).

## 代码

````sql
```mysql
SELECT substr(trans_date, 1, 7) as month, 
    country, 
    count(id) as trans_count, 
    sum(case when state = "approved" then 1 else 0 end) as approved_count, 
    sum(amount) as trans_total_amount,
    sum(case when state = "approved" then amount else 0 end) as approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
group by month, country
